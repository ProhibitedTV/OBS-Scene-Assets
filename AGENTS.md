# Repository contribution guidelines

- Keep asset listings (in `README.md`, `docs/asset-catalog.md`, and `assets/index.html`) sorted alphabetically within each category to make it easy to spot missing entries.
- When editing HTML files, use two-space indentation and keep nested lists well formatted for readability.
- Update the documentation and catalog whenever assets are added, removed, or renamed so the written guidance matches the filesystem.
